AssetMapper Component
=====================

The AssetMapper component allows you to expose directories of assets that are
then moved to a public directory with digested (i.e. versioned) filenames. It
also allows you to dump an [importmap](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script/type/importmap)
to allow writing modern JavaScript without a build system.
