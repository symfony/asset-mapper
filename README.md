AssetMapper Component
=====================

The AssetMapper component allows you to expose directories of assets that are
then moved to a public directory with digested (i.e. versioned) filenames. It
also allows you to dump an [importmap](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script/type/importmap)
to allow writing modern JavaScript without a build system.

**This Component is experimental**.
[Experimental features](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/experimental.html)
are not covered by Symfony's
[Backward Compatibility Promise](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/bc.html).
